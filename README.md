Harnessing LLMs for Large-Scale Qualitative Interviews 

Understanding how beliefs and perceptions, from interpersonal matters like perceived discrimination to individual beliefs about disease and health-related behaviour, are key to population health. However, capturing these beliefs at scale, especially for diverse populations characterised by varying disabilities, socio-economic statuses, and cultural backgrounds, presents a challenge. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of beliefs in the context of progressive diseases calls for innovative methodologies. Discuss using Large Language Models (LLMs) as a bridge between traditional epidemiological research and qualitative research, specifically for cardiovascular patients. LLMs offer possibilities such as scalable and in-depth qualitative research.

In this paper, we present an automated Research Assistant that analyses transcribed interviews about barriers and enablers to a behaviour following a theoretical framework.
